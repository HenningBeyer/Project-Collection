# Deforum-Art-Project

## Overview

This is a two-week project about the assigned topic 'Your Future in x Years', which is entirely generated by a Stable Diffusion AI model. The animated story should represent the inner thoughts an arbitrary physicist (not actually me) while he is passing away due to his great age. But before he passes away, his entire life vividly replays itself in his head again, showing his most memorable stages of life, together with an imagined vision of the future.

### Video

The results can be watched at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-6exFRhxuUE) or with the raw video file in actual 4k resolution and 180 fps [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEdUoAhx-FGojV3SojewortPyGayhdXt/view?usp=sharing) (300 MB).

### Effort

It took mainly effort for reasearching for fine-tuning the parameters on the public notebook [Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb), and especially for adjusting the camera movement, the noise schedules synchronically to the music, and carefully writing prompts of +500 words. Consider opening these notebooks only in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for a better format with parameter inputs. Some notes and useful sources are provided aswell in these notebooks.

It took about 18 hours to render the animation in Colab with a free Tesla T4 GPU and about 40 hours to prepare the notebook. Shotcut was very handy for upscaling to 4k and interpolating to 180 fps pretty rapidly.
